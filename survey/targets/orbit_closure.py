Computes the GL_2(R) orbit closure of a surface

EXAMPLES::

    >>> from survey.sources.ngons import Ngon
    >>> from survey.services import Services
    >>> from survey.sources.surface import Surface
    >>> services = Services()
    >>> services.register(Surface, Ngon((1, 5, 10)))
    >>> o = OrbitClosure(services)
    >>> o.resolve()
    >>> o.result()
    GL(2,R)-orbit closure of dimension at least 8 in H_7(4^3, 0) (ambient dimension 17)
