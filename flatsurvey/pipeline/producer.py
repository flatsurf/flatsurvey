    In the pipeline graph of jobs, any source of an edge is a Producer. So
    producers generate data that is the further processed by registered consumers.

    EXAMPLES::

        >>> from flatsurvey.jobs import SaddleConnections
        >>> surface = Ngon((1, 1, 1))
        >>> connections = SaddleConnections(surface=surface)

        Produce new data and notify all attached consumers of it. Return

        For a producer to be exhausted, it has to be asked to :meth:`produce`
        at least once unsuccesfully. This is a bit unfortunate, but due to the
        lazy implementation, there is currently no other way::

            >>> import asyncio
            >>> asyncio.run(connections.produce())
            False
