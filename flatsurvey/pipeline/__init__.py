r"""
A package describing the abstract computation pipeline, i.e., Consumers and Producers.

When computing with translation surfaces it turned out that, starting from a
fixed surface, many computations rely on the same intermediate data. E.g., many
computations require us to sample saddle connections on that surface. Since we
do not want to compute that shared data several times, we organize the
computation in a pipeline, i.e., a graph where the vertices are called
Producers if they are at the source of an edge and Consumers if they are
targeted by an edge. (And Processors when they are both.)
