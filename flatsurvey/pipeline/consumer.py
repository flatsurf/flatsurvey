An abstract part of a computation that is fed data to compute something.

EXAMPLES:

Any goal of a computation implements the Consumer interface::

    >>> from flatsurvey.jobs import OrbitClosure
    >>> Consumer in OrbitClosure.mro()
    True

class Consumer:
    r"""
    In the pipeline graph of jobs, anything that an edge points to is a
    Consumer. So consumers take in intermediate results that come out of a
    Producer, e.g., OrbitClosure consumes the decompositions that come out of
    FlowDecompositions. FlowDecompositions is itself a Consumer (and a
    Producer) which consumes directions of saddle connections.

    EXAMPLES::

        >>> from flatsurvey.surfaces import Ngon
        >>> from flatsurvey.jobs import SaddleConnectionOrientations, SaddleConnections
        >>> surface = Ngon((1, 1, 1))
        >>> connections = SaddleConnections(surface=surface)
        >>> isinstance(connections, Consumer)
        False
        >>> orientations = SaddleConnectionOrientations(saddle_connections=connections)
        >>> isinstance(orientations, Consumer)
        True

    Each consumer registers to one (or several) ``producers``. Whenever these
    produces generate something new, the consumers ``consume`` method is
    called::

        >>> orientations._producers
        [saddle-connections]

    """
    COMPLETED = False

    def __init__(self, producers):
        self._producers = producers

        # Some consumers can be resolved, e.g., when we are sure that we
        # determined the correct orbit closure, we'd set its _resolved to
        # COMPLETED.
        self._resolved = not Consumer.COMPLETED

        # Register ourselves with each produces so we get notified of any
        # objects they generate.
        for producer in producers:
            producer.register_consumer(self)

    async def consume(self, product, cost):
        r"""
        Process the ``product`` by one of the producers we are attached to and
        return whether we are willing to consumer further data or whether we
        have been completely resolved.

        The ``cost`` is the amount of time it took to generate that product;
        this can be used to determine whether things should be cached for
        example.

        EXAMPLES::

            >>> from flatsurvey.surfaces import Ngon
            >>> from flatsurvey.jobs import SaddleConnectionOrientations, SaddleConnections
            >>> surface = Ngon((1, 1, 1))
            >>> connections = SaddleConnections(surface=surface)
            >>> orientations = SaddleConnectionOrientations(saddle_connections=connections)

            >>> asyncio.run(consume)
            True

        Note that you should actually never call this explicitly. It gets
        called whenever a producer produces something new::

            >>> produce = connections.produce()
            >>> asyncio.run(produce)
            True
