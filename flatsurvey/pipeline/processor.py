r"""
An abstract part of a computation that is fed data to compute something and
passes that data on to the next consumer in the pipeline.

EXAMPLES:

Any step of a computation that converts data implements the Processor
interface, e.g., FlowDecompositions turn saddle connections into flow
decompositions::

    >>> from flatsurvey.jobs import FlowDecompositions
    >>> Processor in FlowDecompositions.mro()
    True

    A processor is simply a producer and a consumer at the same time.

    Implementing classes only have to implement ``_consume`` which must set
    `_current` to the newly produced object.

    EXAMPLES::

        >>> from flatsurvey.surfaces import Ngon
        >>> from flatsurvey.jobs import SaddleConnectionOrientations, SaddleConnections
        >>> surface = Ngon((1, 1, 1))
        >>> connections = SaddleConnections(surface=surface)
        >>> isinstance(connections, Processor)
        False
        >>> orientations = SaddleConnectionOrientations(saddle_connections=connections)
        >>> isinstance(orientations, Processor)
        True

        Ask our producers to produce until our own ``consume`` gets called so
