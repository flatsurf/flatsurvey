The goal of a survey.

A goal is a specialized :class:`Consumer` that is typically not a
:class:`Producer` at the same time and form its verdict from cached previous
runs.

EXAMPLES:

    >>> from flatsurvey.jobs import OrbitClosure
    >>> Goal in OrbitClosure.mro()
    True

class Goal(Consumer):
    r"""
    In the pipeline graph of jobs, a Goal is just a :class:`Consumer` with some
    added facilities that are shared by all actual goals. In practice this
    means that all consumers that are not a :class:`Producer` at the same time
    should most likely inherit from Goal.

    EXAMPLES::

        >>> from flatsurvey.surfaces import Ngon
        >>> from flatsurvey.jobs import FlowDecompositions, SaddleConnectionOrientations, SaddleConnections
        >>> from flatsurvey.jobs.orbit_closure import OrbitClosure
        >>> surface = Ngon((1, 1, 1))
        >>> connections = SaddleConnections(surface)
        >>> flow_decompositions = FlowDecompositions(surface=surface, report=None, saddle_connection_orientations=SaddleConnectionOrientations(connections))
        >>> goal = OrbitClosure(surface=surface, report=None, flow_decompositions=flow_decompositions, saddle_connections=connections, cache=None)
        >>> isinstance(goal, Goal)
        True
