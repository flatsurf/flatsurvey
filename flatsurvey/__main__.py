r"""
Entrypoint to run surveys.

Typically, you invoke this providing some source(s) and some target(s), e.g.,
to compute the orbit closure of all quadrilaterals:
```
python -m survey ngons -n 4 orbit-closure
```

TESTS::
    
    >>> from .test.cli import invoke
    >>> invoke(survey) # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Usage: survey [OPTIONS] COMMAND1 [ARGS]... [COMMAND2 [ARGS]...]...
      Main command, runs a survey; specific survey objects and goals are
      registered automatically as subcommands.
    Options:
      --dry-run
      --help     Show this message and exit.
    Commands:
      completely-cylinder-periodic
      cylinder-periodic-direction
      ngons                         Return all n-gons with the given...
      orbit-closure
