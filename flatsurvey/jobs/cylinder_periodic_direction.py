r"""
Determines whether a surface decomposes completely into cylinders in some direction.

Naturally, this can only be decided partially, i.e., we can say, "yes", there
is such a direction but we can never say "no" _all_ directions have a
non-cylinder.

    >>> from flatsurvey.test.cli import invoke
    >>> from flatsurvey.worker.worker import worker
    >>> invoke(worker, "cylinder-periodic-direction", "--help") # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Usage: worker cylinder-periodic-direction [OPTIONS]
      Determines whether there is a direction for which the surface decomposes
      into cylinders.
    Options:
      --limit INTEGER  stop search after having looked at that many flow
                       decompositions  [default: no limit]
      --cache-only     Do not perform any computation. Only query the cache.
      --help           Show this message and exit.
