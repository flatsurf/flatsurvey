r"""
Entrypoint for the survey worker to solve a single work package.

Invoke this providing a source and some goals, e.g., to compute the orbit closure of a quadrilateral:
```
python -m survey.worker ngon -a 1 -a 2 -a 3 -a 4 orbit-closure
```

# TODO: Improve command layout in usage with https://stackoverflow.com/a/57086581/812379

TESTS::
    
    >>> from ..test.cli import invoke
    >>> invoke(worker) # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Usage: worker [OPTIONS] COMMAND1 [ARGS]... [COMMAND2 [ARGS]...]...
      Main command to invoke the worker; specific objects and goals are
      registered automatically as subcommands.
    Options:
      --debug
      --help   Show this message and exit.
    Commands:
      completely-cylinder-periodic
      cylinder-periodic-direction
      ngon                          Construct an n-gon
      orbit-closure
      pickle                        Load a base64 encoded pickle
