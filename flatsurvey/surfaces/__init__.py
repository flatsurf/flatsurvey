Translation Surfaces and Related Structures of Interest

There are two kinds of closely related structures in the ``sources`` module,
individual sources, such as a particular unfolding of a polygon, and generators
of families of such structures such as unfoldings of all triangles.

This module does not expose the actual structures but the ``click`` command
line interface that is used to generate them.
