class Reporter:
    r"""
    Base class for something that can log progress and results of computations.

    EXAMPLES::

        >>> from flatsurvey.surfaces import Ngon
        >>> surface = Ngon((1, 1, 1))

        >>> from flatsurvey.reporting import Log
        >>> log = Log(surface)
        >>> isinstance(log, Reporter)
        True

    """
    def log(self, source, message, **kwargs):
        r"""
        Write ``message`` emitted by ``source`` to this log.

        Most implementations will not implement this and simply ignore such messages.

        EXAMPLES::

            >>> from flatsurvey.surfaces import Ngon
            >>> surface = Ngon((1, 1, 1))

            >>> from flatsurvey.reporting import Log
            >>> log = Log(surface)
            >>> log.log(source=surface, message="Hello World", additional_data=1337)

        Report a computation's ``result`` from ``source``.

        EXAMPLES::

    def progress(self, source, unit, count, total=None):
        r"""
        Report that ``source`` has made some progress.

        Most implementations will not implement this and simply ignore such messages.

        Make sure that any output has been flushed.
