Wraps several reporters to report on progress and results.

EXAMPLES::

    >>> from flatsurvey.surfaces import Ngon
    >>> surface = Ngon((1, 1, 1))

    >>> from flatsurvey.reporting import Log
    >>> log = Log(surface)
    >>> report = Report([log])
    >>> report.log(surface, "Hello World")
    [Ngon((1, 1, 1))] [Ngon] Hello World
