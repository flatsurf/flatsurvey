r"""
Access cached results from previous runs.

Currently, the only cache we support is a GraphQL/S3 database. It would be
fairly trivial to change that and allow for other similar systems as well.

    A cache that does actually *not* do any caching.

    This is the default cache that is used when the user did not ask for an
    actual cache explicitly on the command line.

        Return our previous verdicts on running ``job`` for ``surface``.

        EXAMPLES:

        ``None``::

    A missing cached result.

        Return a verdict from the found cached results or ``None`` if no result
        could be determined.
