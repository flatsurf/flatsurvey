Access cached results from previous runs.

Currently, the only cache we support is a GraphQL/S3 database. It would be
fairly trivial to change that and allow for other similar systems as well.

    Usage: worker cache [OPTIONS]
      A cache of previous results stored behind a GraphQL API in the cloud.
    Options:

class Cache:

    A cache that does actually *not* do any caching.

    This is the default cache that is used when the user did not ask for an
    actual cache explicitly on the command line.

    def results(self, job, surface=None, exact=False):
        r"""
        Return our previous verdicts on running ``job`` for ``surface``.

        EXAMPLES:

        Since this cache does not actually cache anything, it always returns
        ``None``::

            >>> from flatsurvey.surfaces import Ngon
            >>> from flatsurvey.jobs import CompletelyCylinderPeriodic
            >>> results = Cache().results(surface=Ngon([1,1,1]), job=CompletelyCylinderPeriodic)

class Results:
