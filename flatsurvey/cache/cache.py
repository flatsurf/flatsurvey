r"""
Access cached results from previous runs.

Currently, the only cache we support is a plain-text database stored in .json
files and some accompanying Python pickles. It would be fairly trivial to
change that and allow for other similar systems as well (and we at some point
supported a GraphQL backend but it turned out to be impractical.)

EXAMPLES::

    >>> from flatsurvey.test.cli import invoke
    >>> from flatsurvey.worker.__main__ import worker
    >>> invoke(worker, "local-cache", "--help") # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Usage: worker local-cache [OPTIONS]
      A cache of previous results stored in local JSON files.
    Options:
      -j, --json PATH  JSON files to read cached data from; can be a glob expression
                       or a directory which is then searched recursively
      --help           Show this message and exit.
