r"""
Access cached results from previous runs.

Currently, the only cache we support is a plain-text database stored in .json
files and some accompanying Python pickles. It would be fairly trivial to
change that and allow for other similar systems as well (and we at some point
supported a GraphQL backend but it turned out to be impractical.)

EXAMPLES::

    >>> from flatsurvey.test.cli import invoke
    >>> from flatsurvey.worker.__main__ import worker
    >>> invoke(worker, "local-cache", "--help") # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Usage: worker local-cache [OPTIONS]
      A cache of previous results stored in local JSON files.
    Options:
      -j, --json PATH  JSON files to read cached data from; can be a glob expression
                       or a directory which is then searched recursively
      --help           Show this message and exit.

        Return the results for ``job`` that satisfy ``predicate``.

        EXAMPLES:

        Cached results are automatically requested by a goal when
        :meth:`Goal._consume_cache` which calls this method.

        However, the cache can also be queried manually. Let's suppose that we
        have a cache from previous runs::

            >>> from io import StringIO
            >>> cache = Cache(jsons=[StringIO('{"completely-cylinder-periodic": [{"result": null}, {"result": false}]}')], pickles=None)

        Then we can query all cached results for a goal::

            >>> from flatsurvey.jobs import CompletelyCylinderPeriodic
            >>> cache.results(CompletelyCylinderPeriodic)
            [{'result': None}, {'result': False}]

        We can filter the results further by specifying a predicate::

            >>> cache.results(CompletelyCylinderPeriodic, predicate=lambda entry: entry["result"] is not None)
            [{'result': False}]

        Often, you only want results for a specific surface::

            TODO

        We can also only look at results for surfaces with certain properties::

            TODO

        Note that filtering by some properties can be very costly since the
        urface needs to be loaded from pickled storage first. If the pickle is
        not available locally, this requires to download the individual
        pickles::

            TODO

        """
        if predicate is None:
            def predicate(entry):
                return True

        key = job.name()

        from flatsurvey.cache.results import Results
        return Results(
            job=job,
            results=[
                entry
                for entry in self._results.get(key, [])
                if predicate(entry)
            ],
        )
