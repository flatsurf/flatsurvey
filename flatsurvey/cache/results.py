    Results from a cache.

    EXAMPLES::

        >>> from flatsurvey.surfaces import Ngon
        >>> from flatsurvey.jobs import FlowDecompositions, SaddleConnectionOrientations, SaddleConnections, CompletelyCylinderPeriodic
        >>> from flatsurvey.cache import Cache

        >>> flow_decompositions = FlowDecompositions(surface=surface, report=None, saddle_connection_orientations=SaddleConnectionOrientations(SaddleConnections(surface)))

        >>> goal = CompletelyCylinderPeriodic(report=None, flow_decompositions=flow_decompositions, cache=None)

        Return a verdict for the job from this set of results.

        EXAMPLES:

        We provide a cache with some previous results, one inconclusive, one
        negative::

            >>> from io import StringIO
            >>> from flatsurvey.cache import Cache
            >>> cache = Cache(jsons=[StringIO('{"completely-cylinder-periodic": [{"result": null}, {"result": false}]}')], pickles=None)

            >>> from flatsurvey.jobs import CompletelyCylinderPeriodic
            >>> results = cache.results(CompletelyCylinderPeriodic, predicate=lambda entry: True)

        Since we had found that the surface is not completely cylinder periodic
        previously, we return that verdict::

            >>> import asyncio
            >>> asyncio.run(results.reduce())
            False
