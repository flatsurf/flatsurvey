r"""
Access a database of pickles storing parts of previous computations.

This modules supplements :module:`flatsurvey.cache.Cache`. The cache in JSON
files contains references to pickles. These pickles are resolved here.

Currently, this is mostly a placeholder. We have lots of pickles from previous
runs but unpickling them is not implemented in much generality, see #10.
